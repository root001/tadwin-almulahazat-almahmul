# Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Using an emulator

Yes ‚Äî you‚Äôll need to run npx react-native run-android (after starting your Android emulator) so Metro can send your app‚Äôs JavaScript to it.

Here‚Äôs the full walkthrough:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Android Studio & Setup SDK

If you haven‚Äôt already:

Install Android Studio (includes emulator and SDK tools).

In Android Studio ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Appearance & Behavior ‚Üí System Settings ‚Üí Android SDK:

Install the Android SDK Platform for the Android version you want.

Install Android SDK Build-Tools and Platform Tools.

Add SDK tools to your system PATH (so adb works). Typically:

C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools


or on Mac/Linux:

~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools

2Ô∏è‚É£ Start an Android Emulator

Open Android Studio ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Device Manager.

Create a Virtual Device (Pixel 6 or similar) with a supported API level (React Native usually works well with API 33 or 34).

Start the emulator ‚Äî wait until it‚Äôs fully booted.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Start Metro Bundler

In your React Native project folder:

npm start


or

npx react-native start


This is the Metro server you saw at localhost:8081.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Build and Install the App

With Metro running in a separate terminal, open a new terminal window and run:

npx react-native run-android


What this does:

Compiles the native Android code.

Installs the APK on the emulator.

Connects the app to Metro bundler for live reload.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Verify & Use

Your app should open automatically in the emulator.

Any JavaScript changes will reload instantly via Metro.

‚úÖ Pro Tip:
If you want to skip manually starting Metro, you can just run:

npx react-native run-android


It will:

Start Metro automatically (if not running).

Build & install the app.

If you want, I can also give you ADB commands to check that your emulator is detected before running the build ‚Äî that way we avoid the classic "No connected devices" error.
Do you want me to include that check?

You said:
yes

Alright ‚Äî here‚Äôs how to check that your emulator is properly detected before running npx react-native run-android.

ADB Device Check Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure ADB is on Your PATH

If you installed Android Studio and SDK, adb (Android Debug Bridge) should be in:

Windows

C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools


Mac/Linux

~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools


Make sure this folder is in your PATH so you can run adb from any terminal.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Start Your Emulator

Open Android Studio ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Device Manager ‚Üí start the device.

Or start it via command line:

emulator -avd <Your_AVD_Name>

3Ô∏è‚É£ Check for Connected Devices

In a terminal:

adb devices


You should see something like:

List of devices attached
emulator-5554   device


If it says offline, unauthorized, or the list is empty:

Make sure the emulator is fully booted.

Restart ADB:

adb kill-server
adb start-server
adb devices

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run Your App

Once the emulator shows as a device, run:

npx react-native run-android


This will:

Start Metro (if not already running).

Build & install your app on the emulator.

Connect to Metro for live reload.

üí° Quick One-Liner
If you want to do everything in one go:

adb devices && npx react-native run-android


That way, if ADB can‚Äôt see the device, you‚Äôll know before the build even starts.

If you want, I can also give you a diagram of how Metro, ADB, and the emulator interact so the whole process is crystal clear. That way, you‚Äôll understand why each step matters.
